When paginating grids, tables, or lists of data, you can use this simple JavaScript library to calculate such things as the total number of pages, the starting number for a specified page, as well as routines for navigating between pages. The library itself does not handle the displaying of data.

All methods are documented and there are unit tests for each method.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ditus-software/pagination-util/issues) for a
list of proposed features (and known issues).
